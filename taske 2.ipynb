      "Here are some suggestions for optimization, notes in code, and writing code docs:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Optimization:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Use a more Pythonic way to indicate that this function should be used with a `with` statement**: Instead of using the `@contextmanager` decorator, you can use the context manager syntax directly on the function definition.\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "from contextlib import contextmanager\n",
      "\n",
      "def my_context():\n",
      "    print(\"Entering the context\")\n",
      "    try:\n",
      "        yield  # This is where the block inside the 'with' statement runs\n",
      "    finally:\n",
      "        print(\"Exiting the context\")\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "This change makes it clearer that this function should be used with a `with` statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Avoid redundant backticks**: You have both single and double backticks in your code. It's best to stick with one convention throughout.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Use more descriptive variable names**: The variable name `yield` could be more descriptive. Consider using `block_to_execute` instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Notes in Code:**\n",
      "\n",
      "To make the code more readable, consider adding comments or notes that explain what each section of code is doing. Here's an updated version with additional comments:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "from contextlib import contextmanager\n",
      "\n",
      "def my_context():\n",
      "    # Print a message to indicate that we're entering the context\n",
      "    print(\"Entering the context\")\n",
      "\n",
      "    try:\n",
      "        # Yield control to the block inside the 'with' statement\n",
      "        block_to_execute = yield  # This is where the actual execution happens\n",
      "    finally:\n",
      "        # Regardless of what happens in the block, print a message to indicate that we're exiting\n",
      "        print(\"Exiting the context\")\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "**Code Docs:**\n",
      "\n",
      "To make it easier for others (or yourself in the future) to understand how to use this function, consider adding docstrings:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "from contextlib import contextmanager\n",

      "    allowing it to execute arbitrary code.\n",
